# havock8s: Chaos Engineering for Stateful Kubernetes Workloads

## 🎯 Session Overview

**Duration**: 35 minutes  
**Type**: Breakout Session  
**Track**: Observability & Reliability  
**Level**: Intermediate

## 👥 Target Audience

This session is designed for:
- Site Reliability Engineers (SREs)
- DevOps practitioners
- Platform engineers
- Developers managing stateful applications on Kubernetes

**Prerequisites**: Basic understanding of Kubernetes and interest in system resilience through chaos engineering.

## 🎓 Abstract

While chaos engineering has revolutionized how we test stateless services, stateful workloads remain a challenging frontier. Databases, message queues, and persistent storage systems present unique complexities that traditional chaos engineering tools often overlook. Enter Havock8s—a Kubernetes-native framework that bridges this gap, enabling comprehensive chaos experiments for stateful applications.
